Start:
    - In the terminal write the command: 'python3 statesGame.py'

During game:
    - The screen will show up with a text input where you guess the states. 
    - If you get the state wrong the game will not end and a new text input will show up 
    - You can move the text input anywhere on the screen to see the map an plan your next state

Finish:
    - Perhaps you could not find all the states, in this case, if you type 'exit' in the text input the game          gets exited and a file is created to see which states you have missed.
    - If you gotten all 50 states then the game will exit on its own and you won.
